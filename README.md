Initiative-Tracker

This is an initiative tracker I wrote to be used for D&D to make it easier for me to roll initiative for a bunch of enemies all at once. 
By making pre made monster groups into text files, it can be useful for quickly loading up a fight and keeping the game moving smoothly.

FORMAT

Party file format:

The program will concatenate all words up to the vertical line into the character name 
Current health 
Maximum health

Enemy file format:

First number is the total modifier to initiative the enemy has
All words up to the vertical line make up the monster name
Monster's current health
Monster's maximum health

There are examples of both types of files included

Make sure each character and monster has a unique name to ensure the functions work properly.
